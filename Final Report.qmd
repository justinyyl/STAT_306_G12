## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(car)
library(leaps)
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
# Read the CSV file
data <- read.csv("data/colorectal_cancer_dataset.csv")

# Select the data in USA
usa_data <- data %>%
  filter(Country == "USA")

# Remove Patient_ID and Country
colorectal_usa <- usa_data %>%
  select(-Patient_ID, -Country)
```
