## Introduction

### Study Objective

Clearly define the research questions or objectives.

### Dataset Overview

Describe:

-   Where the data comes from

-   What each variable represents

-   How the data was collected (if known)

### Motivation

Why is this question or data important/interesting?

## Analysis

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### Data Visualizations

```{r}

```

#### Summary Correlations

```{r}

```

#### Interpretation of Findings

Pattern, trends, suggested operations

### Model Choice and Reasoning

#### Linear Regression

explain why choose this model based on EDA and Data description

#### Data Transformations

```{r}

```

#### Model Selection

```{r}

```

### Statistical Analysis

```{r}

```

### Results Interpretation

inference results

## Conclusion

### Main Findings

Interpreting result in real-world context, careful about causality

### Limitations

-   Discuss possible sources of bias, limitations in data, model assumptions

-   Suggest improvements or next steps

### Potential Further research

Mention anything interesting you found that doesnâ€™t fit elsewhere
